    This page contains a list of all completed specifications and drafts by the CSS WG (formerly ‘CSS & FP WG’). If you want to follow the development of CSS3, this is the place to start. You have ideas? Contributions? See ‘If you want to help’ on this page.

  A specification is not a manual. There is no excuse for badly written drafts and please complain if you find one. But specs do target a specific audience. See fantasai's Understanding the CSS Specifications.. J. David Eisenberg has written another useful How to read W3C specs. Or you can read about ‘modules,’ ‘levels,’ ‘snapshots’ and the CSS process.</p>
